# Movie Recommendation System

A simple movie recommendation system implemented in Python. This system allows users to add, search, delete, and recommend movies based on their ratings. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing a collection of movies.

## Features

- **Add Movie**: Add new movies to the system.
- **Search Movies**: Search for movies by title or genre.
- **Delete Movie**: Delete a movie from the system by title.
- **Recommend Top Movies**: Get a list of top N movies based on their ratings.
- **Display Movies**: Display a list of movies with their details.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommendationsystem.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd movierecommendationsystem

3. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python movie_recommendation_system.py

# CNN Image Classification Model

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is designed to classify images of mathematical symbols, whether they are sourced from a local directory, from the web, or hand-drawn in a paint application.

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification tasks by automatically learning features from input images. This project leverages the power of CNNs to accurately classify mathematical symbols with an impressive accuracy rate of 98%.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Utilizes a CNN to classify images of mathematical symbols.
- **Source Flexibility:** Supports classification of symbols from local directories, web images, and hand-drawn symbols.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves a classification accuracy of 98%.
   
## Usage

1. **Run the script to start using the Movie Recommendation System.**
   ```sh
   python movie_recommendation_system.py**Model Training:** Train the CNN model using the provided dataset. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.

2. The system will execute a series of predefined commands demonstrating the functionality:

- Adding movies to the collection
- Searching for movies by title
- Recommending the top 3 movies
- Deleting a movie by title
- Displaying all movies in the collection

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Namans12/CNN-Image-Classification-Model.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Train the model:** Train the model using your dataset or use the pre-trained weights provided.

4. **Start classifying images:** Use the trained model to classify images of mathematical symbols!
